Overview
Create a new HTML file (do not reuse your code from Week 3) and make it look better with CSS, then validate the HTML and CSS and create a Readme file.

Guidelines and Expectations
Experiment with the different properties that affect text display, and various text formats to create an effective and interesting page design. 

Be creative and come up with the formatting (text, background, spacing) to make this jump out and catch a viewer's attention.
